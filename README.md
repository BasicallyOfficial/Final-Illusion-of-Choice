# **101 Final-Illusion-of-Choice**

This is my first ever game, and it is a choose your own adventure game where you don't have any choices. It is an exercise in thinking about the concept of free will, and whether humans possess the capacity to make decisions that shape their future, or if fate is already predetermined. I used the p5js community library "Scribble" and photoshop to create the visual style and assets to give a deceivingly innocent and simple appearance. In addition, I also used the "Howler" library for the music. It is also inspired by other existentialist games such as The Stanley Parable from 2013.

## **Project Timeline**

### Expanded Framework

By 5/8 I plan to have the outlined framework ready for the planned additions to my project

### Mechanically Complete

By 5/11 I want to have implemented the new levels, choices, and mechanics of the final game, possibly even adding different endings available to the player furthering the messages and themes of the original game

### Updated Visuals and Assets

By 5/15 I hope to have updated the visual elements of the project including assets, fonts, and the webpage background

### Debugging and Sound Design

By 5/20 I will have ironed out all my bugs and have added music and sound effects to fully immerse the player into the experience, and make a more lasting impression on my audience
